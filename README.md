A custom OS for a custom watch

=======

This project was aimed to giving me (seth) a programming challenge while also creating something somewhat interesting. 

The final goal of this project is to create a watch
that can play games, play music, display basic 3D (wireframe)
and be somewhat programmable via micro SD card.
